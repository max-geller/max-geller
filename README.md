### Hi there :wave:

Construction professional by day, and software enthusiast by night. Based in  Phoenix, AZ ðŸŒµ.

My name is Max Geller, and I'm passionate about building bridges between construction and code.


As an Electrical Preconstruction Manager in the construction industry, I harness the power of software development to enhance project cost estimation and the analysis of historical construction cost data. I'm always excited to learn and collaborate. My GitHub is a showcase of my passion for coding and its potential to revolutionize the modern, data-driven construction landscape.
